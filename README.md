# GadgetHome unified commerce

The active application lives at this folder's root. It integrates the wellness storefront from **health-home-hub-main**, the gallery/package/checkout journey from **product-showcase-main**, and the administration design and management areas from **complete-project**. The three original folders remain untouched as references and are excluded from the active build.

The supplied projects contained UI prototypes, not a working backend. This application adds the shared database, API, authentication and order processing. See [the architecture inspection and integration plan](INTEGRATION_PLAN.md).

## Run locally

Requires **Node.js 24+** and pnpm. Run commands from this directory, not an original project folder.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm db:seed
pnpm admin:create
pnpm dev
```

- Store: http://localhost:5173
- Administration: http://localhost:5173/admin
- API during development: http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/health
- `pnpm build && pnpm start` serves the built application and API together at http://127.0.0.1:3001 when running locally.

`admin:create` prompts for your email, name and a hidden password of at least 12 characters. There is **no default administrator account** in the store database. Never put administrator credentials in frontend variables. `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_NAME`, and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` can be supplied securely as process environment variables for noninteractive setup. Existing accounts are not overwritten. `pnpm admin:reset` resets an existing administrator password and revokes its sessions; this requires local server access.

The seed command is repeatable and preserves existing data. It creates **demonstration products, prices, inventory, policies, a combo offer and SAVE10**. Review all seeded content before accepting real orders. Prices are editable; the conflicting sample prices in the originals have been consolidated into the package prices from the product showcase.

Admin changes appear immediately on the next API request. Open customer pages refresh on focus and every 15 seconds, including cart/checkout quotes. Admin edits use versions to prevent overwriting stock or other changes made since the form was opened.

## Money, stock and order rules

- Currency is BDT. Database/API monetary values are integer **poisha** (100 = ৳1); customer, product and fixed-discount forms display taka.
- A variant is a stocked **sellable package**, not a shared pool of loose pieces. A family pack with stock 10 means 10 complete family packs. Selling a family pack does not decrement the separate single-pack SKU. This avoids inventing undocumented inventory conversion rules.
- Combos use the first active package of each selected product. The combo's tier determines its price; each component's stock is validated and decremented. Select products whose first active package is appropriate for the offer.
- Shipping uses the configured delivery area; free-shipping thresholds apply to the pre-coupon merchandise subtotal. Coupons can discount merchandise or shipping. Returned/cancelled orders release their coupon redemption and restore stock exactly once.
- Allowed lifecycle: pending → confirmed → processing → shipped → delivered; pending/confirmed/processing may cancel; shipped/delivered may return. Shipping requires carrier and tracking details.
- Changing payment status records an administrator's verification. **It does not charge or refund money.** Manual mobile payments remain `pending_verification` until reviewed.
- A product or variant used in an order must be archived/deactivated rather than deleted. Historical order item descriptions and prices remain unchanged.
- Guest order access is limited to the original browser session or the order's private 64-character tracking code. Save that code from confirmation. Signed-in customers can also see their own orders.

```

## Verification

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm format:check
```

Tests create isolated databases and do not modify your store. They exercise authorization, CSRF/origin enforcement, catalog synchronization, stale edits, cart isolation, price tampering, stock races, duplicate orders, guest order privacy, lifecycle/restocking, coupon limits, combos, category rules, phone validation, registration, manual payments and uploads.

For manual UI verification after building, `node tests/preview.mjs` runs an **in-memory, loopback-only disposable store** on port 3002. Its test-only credentials are printed by that command. Never deploy this fixture or expose its port publicly.

## Deployment and operations

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the environment. For deployment:

```dotenv
NODE_ENV=production
APP_ORIGIN=https://shop.your-domain.example
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=3001
DATABASE_PATH=/persistent/private/commerce.sqlite
UPLOAD_DIR=/persistent/uploads
TRUST_PROXY=1
```

Set `TRUST_PROXY=1` **only** behind a single trusted reverse proxy, and prevent direct public access to the Node port. Proxy the entire website and `/api` to the same application origin. Terminate HTTPS at the proxy. Production rejects a missing/non-HTTPS `APP_ORIGIN`; session cookies are Secure, HttpOnly and SameSite=Strict. Only the built `dist/` and uploads are served, never the repository/database.

Build with the pinned lockfile, run the seed and admin setup deliberately, and start under a service manager with restart/log rotation. The database and upload paths must survive deployments. `/api/health` checks database availability. The application applies request limits, JSON size limits, image size/signature checks, CSRF/origin verification, prepared SQL, role checks and security headers.

**Deployment model:** one Node server using SQLite WAL on a durable local filesystem. Do not use an ephemeral/serverless filesystem, a network share for the SQLite file, or multiple replicas against independent database copies. API/catalog/report list responses currently load complete collections; this is a practical single-store baseline, **not a demonstrated high-volume deployment**. Before horizontal scaling or a large catalog, migrate the repository layer to a shared PostgreSQL database, introduce server pagination/aggregates, shared session/rate-limit storage and object storage for uploads. The pricing/order domain is separated to support that work.

### Backups

`pnpm db:backup` creates a consistent `VACUUM INTO` database snapshot in `data/backups/`. Also back up the upload directory to private durable storage. Exercise restoration before launch. To restore, stop the application, preserve the current database and its WAL/SHM files, restore a verified snapshot to `DATABASE_PATH`, restore matching uploads, and restart. Do not copy just the live SQLite main file while writes are occurring.

### External services and launch work

The originals did not contain working payment gateways, email/SMS delivery, Meta CAPI, Stripe or ad network integrations despite some sample “connected” labels. This application does not claim those services are connected. Automatic payments/refunds, notifications, shipment creation and ad event forwarding require provider credentials, webhook verification and provider-specific integration/testing. Campaigns and Meta fields are planning/metadata tools, not an ad-dispatch service. Email verification and self-service email password recovery are not configured.

Before going live, create your administrator, replace demonstration inventory and policies, configure contact/shipping/payment information, select and configure hosting/HTTPS/backups, verify your real payment procedures and perform a staging purchase/fulfillment check. Automated tests and a successful local build do not establish production readiness for an unspecified hosting/payment environment.
